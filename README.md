# Data Mining Course Assignments
Data Mining course assignments and quizes at Indiana University.

## Clustering using k-Means
Clustering breast cancer dataset using k-Means
### Methodology
Implementation of k-Means algorithm. Implement cross-validation for choosing a k. The algorithm was implemented using Java and the matrix operations are supported using the EJML framework. The results are plotted using ggplot library from R.

## Data Mining Algorithms
Use a synthetic movie dataset and apply following algorithms for movie recommendation.
1. Using k-Means clustering
2. A-Priori Method, Market Basket Analysis
3. K-Nearest Neighbours
4. Naive Bayes
5. Agglomerative Hierarchial clustering

## Music Prediction
Use Naive Bayes classifier for classifying a song's genre. The dataset is from the tune-edit music classification challenge. [Link](http://tunedit.org/challenge/music-retrieval/genres).
